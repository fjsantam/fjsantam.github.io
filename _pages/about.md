Hello! 

## My Work and Research

## Educational Background

## Affiliated Academic Communities

For the past several years, my academic "home conference" and community has been [ARNOVA](https://www.arnova.org/), the Association for Research on Nonprofit Organizations and Voluntary Action. In addition to attending and presenting at the annual conference and being a founding member of the Data and Analytics Section, I have attended the conference as a Graduate Diversity Scholar (2018 and 2019) and participated in the Doctoral Fellows Workshop (2020). I have attended and presented at the [West Coast Nonprofit Data Conference](https://westcoastnonprofitdata.org/) for several years as well. 

More recently, I have joined [ISTR](https://www.istr.org/), the International Society for Third-Sector Research. In the 2021 annual conference, I participated in the PhD Seminar as well as gave a presentation and moderated a panel. I have also joined [ASPA](https://aspanet.secure-platform.com/), the American Society for Public Administration, and attended the 2021 conference.

For more information on my presentations, please navigate to my [CV](/cv) or the [presentations](/presentations) page.


### Template Info
This website was built using the [academic pages](https://academicpages.github.io/) GitHub repository as a template, which I forked from to create [the repository for this page](https://github.com/fjsantam/fjsantam.github.io). More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
