This repository is forked from [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), a Github Pages template for academic personal websites, itself forked from mmistakes/minimal-mistakes. I have further modified some of the underlying HTML code, for example, edits to the [author profile](author-profile.html) portion of the website.

The source README file is located [here](README_source.md), with instructions on how to build your own such site.
