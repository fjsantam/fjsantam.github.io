This repository is forked from [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), a Github Pages template for academic personal websites, itself forked from mmistakes/minimal-mistakes. 

I have further modified some of the underlying HTML code, for example: 
* edits to the [author profile](_includes/author-profile.html) portion of the website 
* generating custom [favicons](images/favicon), the small icon associated with the tab of a website in your browser
* embedding a PDF of my CV into the relevant page, rather than solely presenting a download link ([some example solutions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/291813/recommended-way-to-embed-pdf-in-html))

The source README file is located [here](README_source.md), with instructions on how to build your own such site.
